# Bayesian-inference-on-Covid-19-incidence-in-England
implement and sample from the model for these data, using JAGS and rjags. Your aim should be to produce the posterior mean for the ni trajectory, along with 95% credible intervals. You should produce a single summary plot, showing the daily deaths against day of the year (day 1 being Jan 1 2020), with the posterior
mean incidence ni and 95% credible interval overlaid on the plot (probably using lines). Also overlay the posterior mean for mi to illustrate model fit. Finally mark the first day of UK lockdown (24th March 2020) on the
plot as a vertical line on the appropriate day.
